Description:

This is a python module for the spread tool kit that
I fished out of Tim Peters zope archives.

I have updated to work with python 2.6/2.7 and spread 4.20
In the process, I simplified a grotty section of code,
added a couple of useful attributes to the MemberMessage object
and updated the tests.

See the README file for installation details, etc,
which is still largely relevant and only a bit outdated
in places.

My updates work for me. Feedback, patches, etc would be
useful if you have any.
